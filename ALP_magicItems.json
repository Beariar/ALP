"Weapon Oils are alchemical concoctions designed by monster hunters to imbue their weapons with specific types of damage. These oils replace the weaponâ€™s normal damage type with a different one upon application.",
"<b>Each oil belongs to one of five tiers of rarity and provides a distinct elemental, magical, or supernatural damage type:</b>",
"<ul><li>- <b>Basic (Common) Oils</b> [Fire, Cold]</li><li>- <b>Searing (Uncommon) Oils</b> [Poison, Acid]</li><li>- <b>Storm (Rare) Oils</b> [Lightning, Thunder]</li><li>- <b>Exalted (Very Rare) Oils</b> [Radiant, Necrotic]</li><li>- <b>Invisible (Legendary) Oils</b> [Force, Psychic]</li></ul>",
"<b>Additionally, Weapon Oils are classified by potency:</b><ul><li>- <b>Minimus:</b> The weapon deals damage with a die half the size of its original damage die (e.g., 1d12 becomes 1d6, 2d6 becomes 2d3).</li><li>- <b>Medianus:</b> The weapon retains its original damage dice, but the damage type changes.</li><li>- <b>Maximus:</b> The weapon deals damage with double the number of its original damage dice (e.g., 1d12 becomes 2d12, 2d6 becomes 4d6).</li></ul>",
"<b>Application and Activation:</b> Applying an oil to a weapon takes 5 minutes. Once applied, the oil remains on the weapon for 5 hours, but its magical effect must be activated. Activating an oil is a free action, and once activated, it lasts for 10 minutes. If deactivated before the duration ends, the oil is expended and cannot be reused.",
"<b>Special Properties:</b> A weapon enhanced with an oil loses its original damage type unless it has the Flowing property. Only one oil can be applied to a weapon at a time. These oils are rare and typically reserved for experienced hunters.",
"<b>Example Conversions:</b>",
"- A Greataxe (1d12 Slashing) with Basic Fire Minimus deals 1d6 Fire damage.",
"- A Greataxe with Basic Fire Medianus deals 1d12 Fire damage.",
"- A Greataxe with Basic Fire Maximus deals 2d12 Fire damage.",
"- A Maul (2d6 Bludgeoning) with Storm Lightning Minimus deals 2d3 Lightning damage.",
"- A Maul with Storm Lightning Medianus deals 2d6 Lightning damage.",
"- A Maul with Storm Lightning Maximus deals 4d6 Lightning damage.",
"Weapon Oils provide hunters with a means to overcome creatures resistant or immune to conventional attacks, ensuring they are always prepared for the hunt."
