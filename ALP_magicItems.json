"Weapon Oils are alchemical concoctions designed by monster hunters to imbue their weapons with specific types of damage. These oils replace the weapon’s normal damage type with a different one upon application.",
"Each oil belongs to one of five tiers of rarity and provides a distinct elemental, magical, or supernatural damage type:",
"<ul><li>Basic Oils (Fire, Cold)</li><li>Searing Oils (Poison, Acid)</li><li>Storm Oils (Lightning, Thunder)</li><li>Exalted Oils (Radiant, Necrotic)</li><li>Invisible Oils (Force, Psychic)</li></ul>",
"Additionally, Weapon Oils are classified by potency:",
"Minimus: The weapon deals damage with a die half the size of its original damage die (e.g., 1d12 becomes 1d6, 2d6 becomes 2d3).",
"Medianus: The weapon retains its original damage dice, but the damage type changes.",
"Maximus: The weapon deals damage with double the number of its original damage dice (e.g., 1d12 becomes 2d12, 2d6 becomes 4d6).",
"<b>Application and Activation:</b> Applying an oil to a weapon takes 5 minutes. Once applied, the oil remains on the weapon for 5 hours, but its magical effect must be activated. Activating an oil is a free action, and once activated, it lasts for 10 minutes. If deactivated before the duration ends, the oil is expended and cannot be reused.",
"<b>Special Properties:</b> A weapon enhanced with an oil loses its original damage type unless it has the Flowing property. Only one oil can be applied to a weapon at a time. These oils are rare and typically reserved for experienced hunters.",
"<b>Example Conversions:</b>",
"A Greataxe (1d12 Slashing) with Basic Fire Minimus deals 1d6 Fire damage.",
"A Greataxe with Basic Fire Medianus deals 1d12 Fire damage.",
"A Greataxe with Basic Fire Maximus deals 2d12 Fire damage.",
"A Maul (2d6 Bludgeoning) with Storm Lightning Minimus deals 2d3 Lightning damage.",
"A Maul with Storm Lightning Medianus deals 2d6 Lightning damage.",
"A Maul with Storm Lightning Maximus deals 4d6 Lightning damage.",
"Weapon Oils provide hunters with a means to overcome creatures resistant or immune to conventional attacks, ensuring they are always prepared for the hunt."
