You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about such creatures.\r\n\r\nThe Hunter\u2019s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature\u2019s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\nHemocraft save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier\r\n(your choice between Intelligence or Wisdom)"

You know one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the \u201CBlood Curses\u201D section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new blood curse, you can also choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse.\r\n\r\nEach time you use your Blood Maledict feature, you choose which curse to invoke from the curses you know. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by taking necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage can\u2019t be reduced in any way. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse\u2019s description. Creatures that do not have blood are immune to blood curses unless you have amplified the curse.\r\n\r\nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Blood Maledict twice between rests starting at 6th level, three times starting at 13th level, and four times starting at 17th level.\r\n\r\n - Blood Curses -\r\nAs a blood hunter, you have access to a range of blood curses that can tax the resilience of any foe.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Anxious\r\nAs a bonus action, you harry the body or mind of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Until the end of your next turn, Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against the cursed creature have advantage.\r\n\r\nAmplify. The next Wisdom saving throw the cursed creature makes before this curse ends has disadvantage.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of Binding\r\nAs a bonus action, you attempt to bind a Large or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet of you, which must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the cursed creature\u2019s speed is reduced to 0 and it can\u2019t use reactions until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAmplify. This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect any creature regardless of size. The cursed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of Bloated Agony\r\nAs a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, causing its body to swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature has disadvantage on Strength checks and Dexterity checks, and takes 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one attack during its turn.\r\n\r\nAmplify. This curse lasts for 1 minute. The cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of Corrosion\r\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mutant\r\n\r\nAs a bonus action, you cause a creature within 30 feet of you to become poisoned. The cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.\r\n\r\nAmplify. The cursed creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage when you inflict this curse, and it takes this damage again each time it fails a Constitution saving throw to end the curse.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Exorcist\r\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Ghostslayer\r\n\r\nAs a bonus action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is charmed or frightened, or which is under a possession effect. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.\r\n\r\nAmplify. A creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse takes 3d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of Exposure\r\nWhen a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken its resilience. Until the end of the target\u2019s next turn, it loses resistance to all the damage types dealt by the triggering attack or spell (including for that triggering effect).\r\n\r\nAmplify. The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, but has resistance to those damage types until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Eyeless\r\nWhen a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature\u2019s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature\u2019s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack hits or misses. The creature is immune to this curse if it is immune to the blinded condition.\r\n\r\nAmplify. You apply this curse to all the creature\u2019s attack rolls until the end of the creature\u2019s turn. You roll separately for each affected attack.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Fallen Puppet\r\nWhen a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to instill that creature with a final act of aggression. The creature immediately makes one weapon attack against a target of your choice within its range.\r\n\r\nAmplify. You can first cause the cursed creature to move up to half its speed, and you grant a bonus to its attack roll equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Howl\r\nPrerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan\r\n\r\nAs an action, you unleash a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, it is stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.\r\n\r\nYou can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.\r\n\r\nAmplify. The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Marked\r\nAs a bonus action, you mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you hit the cursed creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.\r\n\r\nAmplify. The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Muddled Mind\r\nAs a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell or using a feature that requires concentration. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it makes to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAmplify. The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nBlood Curse of the Soul Eater\r\nPrerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Profane Soul\r\n\r\nWhen a creature that isn\u2019t a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to offer their life energy to your patron in exchange for power. Until the end of your next turn, you make attacks with advantage and you have resistance to all damage.\r\n\r\nAmplify. Additionally, you regain an expended warlock spell slot. Once you\u2019ve amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again."

The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo \u201Cthe Taming\u201D\u2014the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor-sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to their own hunger.\r\n\r\n - The Burden of Lycanthropy -\r\nThose inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible weight it imposes on them and the challenges it brings. Where most afflicted by the curse of lycanthropy grow wicked, deranged, and even murderous, Lycan blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and the power of their blood magic. A member of the Order of the Lycan cannot spread their curse through blood unless they wish to, and one of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another creature without the order\u2019s sanction.\r\n\r\nIf a member of the Order of the Lycan is ever cured of their lycanthropic curse, it brings terrible shame to their name and the order. Members who have been cleansed against their will readily return to the order to undergo a renewed initiation of the Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring their honor.\r\n\r\nLycanthropy comes in many forms bound to specific beasts, with wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat the best-known variations. The particular strain of the lycanthropic curse defines the physical traits that manifest in a Lycan blood hunter\u2019s hybrid transformation, even as the benefits the curse bestows remain relatively uniform.",
