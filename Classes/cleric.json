See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.\r\n\r\nCantrips\r\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\r\n\r\nPreparing and Casting Spells\r\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\r\n\r\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\r\n\r\nSpellcasting Ability\r\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\nSpell save DC = 8 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus\r\nSpell attack modifier = Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus\r\nRitual Casting\r\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\r\n\r\nSpellcasting Focus\r\nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells."

Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.

It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

                    "description": "The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.\r\n\r\nLaw establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.\r\n\r\nAt each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.\r\n\r\nOrder Domain Spells\r\nCleric Level\tSpells\r\n1st\tcommand, heroism\r\n3rd\thold person, zone of truth\r\n5th\tmass healing word, slow\r\n7th\tcompulsion, locate creature\r\n9th\tcommune, dominate person",
