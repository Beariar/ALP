You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.\r\n - The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.\r\n - A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.\r\nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely.

The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies."

                    "feature_detail": "You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.\r\n\r\nTools Required\r\nYou produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus\u2014specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool\u2014in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.\r\n\r\nAfter you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.\r\n\r\nThe Magic of Artifice\r\nAs an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist's supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker's tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal\u2014perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.\r\n\r\nSuch details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.\r\n\r\nCantrips (0-Level Spells)\r\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.\r\n\r\nWhen you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.\r\n\r\nPreparing and Casting Spells\r\nThe Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\r\n\r\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\r\n\r\nSpellcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\nSpell save DC = 8 + Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus\r\nSpell attack modifier = Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus\r\nRitual Casting\r\nYou can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared."

You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.\r\n\r\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.\r\n\r\nArtificer Infusions\r\nArtificers have invented numerous magical infusions, extraordinary processes that rapidly create magic items. To many, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.\r\n\r\nThe description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.\r\n\r\nSome infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.\r\n\r\nUnless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.\r\n\r\nInfusing an Item\r\nWhenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see \"Attunement\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\r\n\r\nYour infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.\r\n\r\nYou can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.\r\n\r\nIf an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space."
