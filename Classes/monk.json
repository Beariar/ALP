This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\r\n - When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.\r\n\r\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons.

You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\r\n\r\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\nKi save DC = 8 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus\r\n\r\nFlurry of Blows. \r\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\r\n\r\nPatient Defense. \r\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\r\n\r\nStep of the Wind. \r\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn."

As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur-the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk.

As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.\r\n\r\nEach creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.\r\n\r\nYou can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6."

You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.\r\n\r\nIf a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier."
