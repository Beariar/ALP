You are convinced that a tentacle is now growing on you, but no one else can see it.\r\n2\tA psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you.\r\n3\tYou once suffered the dominating powers of an aboleth, leaving a psychic splinter in your mind.\r\n4\tYou were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but the ceremorphosis never completed. And now its psionic power is yours. When you use it, your flesh shines with a strange mucus.\r\n5\tAs a child, you had an imaginary friend that looked like a flumph or a strange platypus-like creature. One day, it gifted you with psionic powers, which have ended up being not so imaginary.\r\n6\tYour nightmares whisper the truth to you: your psionic powers are not your own. You draw them from your parasitic twin!\r\n",
