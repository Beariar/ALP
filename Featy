        <b>Prerequisite:</b> Warlock class, Constitution 13 or higher
        <br>
        <br>Your connection to the eldritch forces and your skills grants you the ability to act as a guardian for your allies. When you choose this feat, you gain the following benefits:
        <br>
        <br><b>Eldritch Ward:</b> When you use your eldritch powers to protect yourself or others, your guardian instincts kick in. When you cast Armor of Agathys spell on yourself you can target one ally on which Armor of Agathys will be casted as well. This does not consume you spell slot, however the Armor of Agathys on ally is one level lower spell then armor on you. If you cast the Armor of Agathys as 1st level you can not target ally as there is no 0 level version of Armor of Agathys.
        <br>
        <br><b>Blasting guard:</b> Once per long rest you can gain an aspect of Eldritch Protector as a bonus action on your turn. While in this state, you can target allies with your eldritch blast. You have advantage on such attack rolls. On hit your eldritch blast does not deal damage but gives temporary health instead. Half of the temporary health rounded down is healing you receive from this. Aspect of Eldritch Beast lasts for 1 minute. If allies already have temporary hit points, this ability would not affect them but it would still heal you.

        <h1>Wizard's Wrath</h1>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> Wizard class, Wisdom 13 or higher
        <br>
        <br>You have learned to tap into the depths of your magical prowess in moments of intense fury and rage, turning your formidable intellect into a destructive force. When you enter the Wizard's Wrath state, you gain the following benefits:
        <br>
        <br><b>Arcane Fury:</b> Once per long rest, you can enter the Wizard's Wrath state as a reaction when you take damage from an attack, spell, or effect that reduces you to half your maximum hit points or below. This state lasts for 1 minute. Wizard's Wrath ends early only if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or you have not taken damage since your last turn.
        <br>
        <br><b>Empowered Spells:</b> While in the Wizard's Wrath state, your spells deal additional damage. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, add your Intelligence modifier twice to the damage. This bonus damage is of the same type as the spell.
        <br>
        <br><b>Resilience:</b> Your rage fuels your determination. You have advantage on concentration saving throws to maintain concentration on spells.
        <br>
        <br><b>Arcane Onslaught:</b> When the Wizard's Wrath state ends, you release a surge of raw arcane power. All your available spell slots of the highest level are consumed. Roll 1d6 for each level of spell slot consumed, you roll the damage for each spell used. The damage type is force. The point of origin is you and radius is 10 feet for each level of the spell slot consumed. (If three 4th level spell slots are consumed you roll 3*4d6 force damage and radius is 40 feet.) 
        <br>
        <br><b>Wizard's Fatigue:</b> When the Wizard's Wrath state ends, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + number of d6s rolled for Arcane Onslaught) or be fatigued. If you fail, you can only cast cantrips for the next 1d3+1 hours; if you succeed, the limitation lasts for 1 hour.

        <b>Prerequisite:</b> Artificer class, Intelligence 13 or higher
        <br>
        <br>You have honed your precision and resourcefulness in combat, allowing you to exploit vulnerabilities in your enemies. When you choose this feat, you gain the following benefits:
        <br>
        <br><b>Vulnerable Strike:</b> When you have advantage on attack against a creature and hit it, you can choose to make your attack deal an extra Intelligence modifier damage of the same type. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature after a short or long rest.
        <br>
        <br><b>Evasive Expert:</b> Your nimbleness in combat allows you to better avoid attacks. Once per long rest when you take the Dodge action, you can choose to add your Intelligence modifier to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn.
        <br>
        <br><b>Plan B:</b> You are quick to find a way out of trouble. If an ally is within 5 feet of you during combat, you can use Disengage as Bonus Action.

        <h1>Crimson Hunter</h1>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> Blood Hunter class, Charisma 13 or higher
        <br>
        <br><b>Hunter's Resonance:</b> Once per long rest, when you activate your Blood Maledict, you can scare up to two allies to improve their actions. Target allies receive the dice size of your Hemocraft Die which can be used for attack rolls or saving throws they make in the next minute.
        <br>
        <br><b>Rite with crimson bubble:</b> When you have crimson Rite active and deal damage to creature you can leave behind a crimson bubble on your last attack. Crimson bubbles stay there until the start of your next turn. While the crimson bubble is active, allies can target it. If the ally attack roll would exceed the creature's AC by more then 2, the crimson bubble pops. Such attack deals extra Hemocraft Die damage of your rite type.
